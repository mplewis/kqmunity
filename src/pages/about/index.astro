      <p>
        The <a href="/scenes/denver">Denver scene</a> started KQmunity in 2024 as
        a hub to help Killer Queen players meet each other, play matches, and build
        local communities. Our site is
        <a href="https://github.com/mplewis/kqmunity" target="_blank"
          >open-source on GitHub</a
        > and we welcome contributions.

        <strong>Want a website for your local scene?</strong> We're happy to help
        you build one, host it here on KQmunity for free, and give you the tools
        to manage your content. We can even plug our bot into your Discord server
        to import your upcoming events and list them on the website.
      </p><p>
        <strong>Already have a website?</strong>
        We can add a link to your website, update your KQmunity listing, or remove
        you entirely if you prefer.
